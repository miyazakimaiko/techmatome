Tech curation news platform for Japanese audiences

<icon>ðŸ“±</icon>

## Context of this project
I used to use news sites and Twitter to catch up with the latest news, but I always felt overwhelmed and tired due to being distracted by small details, unrelated news, and conversations. 

Subscribing to newsletters helped me to some extent, but there were still a few things I didn't like:

- They didn't provide enough information that I as a developer wanted to catch up on.
- They often led me to click on the article itself, even when I just wanted a brief overview.

So, I decided to create an automated curation system that summarises the latest news that I want to consume. 

This was just the beginning, and I came up with the idea to translate those news articles into Japanese. This way, I can cater to Japanese audiences while leveraging the time difference between Japan and Ireland.
